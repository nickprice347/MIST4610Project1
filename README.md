## Team Name: 
61608 Group 5 
## Problem Description: 
The current scenario involves creating a relational database for a tennis club to ensure all data is properly allocated, and the business runs smoothly and efficiently. The majority of the model is centered around the entity “Members”. Members are at the forefront of the business since they determine which transactions take place, what divisions and leagues to join, what courts to reserve in conjunction with the coaches, which coaching programs to be a part of, and more. In addition to members, the club also employs a variety of general staff employees who can fulfill maintenance requests on various courts. The goal of the model is to accurately use and generate data, show the relationships between the various entities, and allow for queries to promptly be asked and solved to easily allow the analysis of data.
## Data Model: 
Explanation of our data model: 

<img width="406" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-26 at 6 04 39 PM" src="https://github.com/HaleyFord/MIST4610Project1/assets/163012596/18e904ff-8d97-43e2-bd1c-01ea7e8e6d43">

*Numbers Match Up With Our Client’s Points*
Our model is structured around a tennis club and its various entities are representative of key daily functions. The members entity is a key aspect of our model, and therefore is present in multiple different relationships. 

1. & 2.


Starting with entities one and two from our client, we created a many to many relationship between members and courts. Members can reserve many courts and courts can have multiple members present on them. The many to many relationship resulted in an associative entity, court reservations.
 
3.


Next, members can belong to many coaching programs and coaching programs have multiple members present in them. These two entities form an associative entity, sessions. Coaching programs and members may also at times have no sessions. 
Additionally, the coaching programs are led by coaches. Coaches have a one to many relationship with coaching programs, as one coach can teach many coaching programs, but a coaching program can only be led by one coach at a time. 
Additionally, the coaches entity has a one to many relationship with the court reservation entity as a coach can make multiple court reservations, but a reservation can only belong to one coach.  

4. 


Members can belong to many tennis leagues, and a tennis league is made up of many members. These two entities have a many to many relationship, which results to an associative entity divisions. 

5.


The Pro Shop Inventory entity can belong to many transactions, and the transactions can consist of multiple pro shop items. These two entities resulted in an associative entity, transaction details. 
Additionally, members can make multiple transactions from the proshop, but a singular transaction can only belong to one member. 

6. & 7.


Our general staff entity can perform maintenance on multiple courts, and each court can have multiple faculty working on its upkeep. Thus an associative entity maintenance request is created to symbolize this many to many relationship. 

## Data Dictionary: 
## Queries: Query 1 Description:

Query 1 lists the ID of the members who have not made any court reservations at the time.

Query 1 allows managers to see which members have not reserved a court. This can be beneficial so that managers can inquire about if there is a reason why the member is being inactive, or if they need assistance with the reservation process. This can also be helpful for managers to determine which members they need to be marketing their services to more to increase revenues.


Query 2 Description: 

Query 2 lists the item type, the item brand, and the sum of the quantity ordered to determine the most popular item. The results are ordered by quantity ordered in descending order.

Proper resource allocation is critical for a business’s longevity. If there’s a higher demand for coaching sessions from a specific age group, assigning more coaches to said age group would result in improved member experience. Knowing court locations and where coaching sessions are being conducted may minimize conflicts with other club activities, thus having strategic planning over such variables will be useful for analysts to anticipate future demand and make keen decisions. 


Query 4 Description:

Query 4 lists the total transaction value for members whose individual total transaction value exceeds the average total transaction value across all members.

Contemporary marketing strategies to maximize consumer loyalty and profit earnings place heavy emphasis on marketing toward the most loyal, highest-spending individuals. Such marketing tactics may include personalized promotions, discounts, or incentives that could sway loyal members to spend even more. Cultivating such strong relationships with said members, may attract new members who aspire to receive similar treatment.

Query 5 allows the manager to see which staff members have “Pending” or uncompleted tasks. This data will show the manager if there are staff members who are not completing their work which is essential for performance reviews, and promotion decisions. This also makes sure that the manager is up to date on what still needs to be completed to ensure the right staff members are spoken to so that jobs are completed effectively and efficiently.
